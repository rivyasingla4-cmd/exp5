EXPERIMENT – 5
# Topic: Dictionary in Python
# Aim
To study and implement the concept of dictionary data structure in Python and perform operations such as creation of dictionary, accessing values, updating elements, removing elements, and solving real-world problems using dictionaries.
# Theory
A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values stored in the form of key–value pairs. Each key in a dictionary must be unique, while values can be of any data type.
Characteristics of Dictionary
Written using curly braces { }
Stores data as key : value pairs
Keys are unique and immutable
Values can be modified
Does not allow duplicate keys
Indexed by keys instead of positions
Dictionary Functions and Methods
dict[key] – Access value using key
len() – Returns number of key–value pairs
type() – Returns data type
update() – Adds or updates key–value pair
values() – Returns all values
pop() – Removes specified key
get() – Returns value of key (avoids error if key not found)
Algorithms
# Algorithm 1: Creation and Display of Dictionary
Start
Create a dictionary with key–value pairs
Print the dictionary
Stop
# Algorithm 2: Accessing Dictionary Value
Start
Create a dictionary
Access value using key
Print the value
Stop
# Algorithm 3: Duplicate Keys in Dictionary
Start
Create a dictionary with duplicate keys
Print the dictionary
Observe that the latest value replaces the old value
Stop
# Algorithm 4: Finding Length of Dictionary
Start
Create a dictionary
Use len() function
Display length
Stop
# lgorithm 5: Finding Type of Dictionary
Start
Create a dictionary
Use type() function
Print the result
Stop
# Algorithm 6: Adding / Updating Key-Value Pair
Start
Create a dictionary
Use update() method to add new key
Print updated dictionary
Stop
# Algorithm 7: Retrieving Values from Dictionary
Start
Create a dictionary
Access value using key
Print the value
Stop
# Algorithm 8: Removing Element from Dictionary
Start
Create a dictionary
Use pop() method to remove key
Print updated dictionary
Stop
# Algorithm 9: Updating Product Price
Start
Create a dictionary of products and prices
Update price using update()
Print updated dictionary
Stop
# Algorithm 10: Searching Student Marks
Start
Create a dictionary of student marks
Accept student name from user
Use get() method to fetch marks
Display marks or “Student not found”
Stop
# Algorithm 11: Username and Password Validation
Start
Create a dictionary of usernames and passwords
Accept username and password from user
Compare entered values with dictionary values
Display login status
Stop
# Algorithm 12: Finding Topper
Start
Create a dictionary of students and marks
Use max() function with key=marks.get
Display topper name and marks
Stop
# conclusion
In this experiment, the dictionary data structure in Python was successfully implemented. Various operations such as accessing values, updating elements, removing entries, and searching data were performed. Dictionaries proved to be efficient for storing and managing data in key–value form and are widely used in real-world applications like student records, login systems, and product management
